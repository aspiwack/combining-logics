I'm writing about ways to build new logics out of logics.

I'll probably jot an idea in from time to time. But it's unlikely to
become much more developed that a brief outline, because it's too time
consuming a project to make this thing really fleshed out.

That being said, this serves as an excuse for me to play with Typst
(which means I may spend more time hacking on the document than
writing contentâ€¦).

You can see the latest version of the document at
https://aspiwack.github.io/combining-logics/combining-logics.pdf
. Typst should eventually gain the ability to output html, in which
case I'll replace the pdf with some html.
