I'm writing about ways to build new logics out of logics.

I'll probably jot an idea in from time to time. But it's unlikely to
become much more developed that a brief outline, because it's too time
consuming a project to make this thing really fleshed out.

Plus, half the reason why I made this repository is to try out
converting Latex into Html, and I'm already frustrated and losing
patience at it. You can see the current poor result at
https://aspiwack.github.io/combining-logics/ .
